# PhotoSearcher

PhotoSearcher is an Android practice project that demonstrates how to build a modern image search application. The app enables users to search for photos based on a query and view the results in an organized, visually appealing layout.

## Overview

This project aims to showcase the implementation of a photo search feature using modern Android technologies. It covers:
- **Network Integration:** Fetching photo data from an external API.
- **Dynamic UI:** Displaying search results in a responsive column.
- **Modern Architecture:** Leveraging contemporary Android Jetpack components (e.g., ViewModel and LiveData) for a clean, maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:**  
  Enter a query to search for photos from a chosen API (e.g., Unsplash, Flickr).

- **Responsive Display:**  
  View the search results in a grid (or list) via a RecyclerView for smooth scrolling and efficient display.

- **Detailed View:**  
  Tap on a photo to open a detailed view with a larger image and additional information.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  Follows Material Design principles to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** – Primary programming language.
- **Retrofit (or similar)** – For handling network requests and API interactions.
- **Glide/Picasso** – For efficient image loading and caching.
- **Android Jetpack Components:**  
  Including ViewModel, LiveData, and Navigation for streamlined app architecture.
- **Material Design Components** – To create a modern and intuitive UI.
