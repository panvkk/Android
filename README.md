# Android Kotlin Projects & Practice

Welcome to my repository for Android development with Kotlin! This collection is a result of my studies using Google's Kotlin course for Android development. It includes fully functional applications as well as practice projects that reflect my learning process and experimentation with new techniques.

## Overview

This repository is organized into several folders that showcase various aspects of Android development:

- **Projects/**  
  Contains complete and more polished Android applications that demonstrate real-world implementations of concepts like image processing, modern UI design, and efficient architecture.  
  - *PixelSorting:* An image processing project that applies glitch-art effects by sorting pixels based on multiple criteria.
  - *PhotoSearcher:* A project demonstrating the use of network integration, dynamic UI with RecyclerView, and API data fetching for a photo search application.

- **Practice/**  
  Includes experimental projects and practice exercises aimed at reinforcing new technologies and design patterns.

- **Exercices/**  
  Contains projects directly related to the study of new technologies

Throughout this repository, you will find examples of:
- **Modern Android Practices:**  
  Using Kotlin, Android Jetpack components (such as ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation), and Material Design principles.
- **Hands-on Learning:**  
  Projects that combine theory with practice, offering a window into my progression as I learn advanced concepts and refine my development skills.
